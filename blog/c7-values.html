    <h2>Affirmations</h2>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmations_%28New_Age%29">Wikipedia</a> does a great job summing up what an affirmation is.
  </br></br>
  <blockquote>
    "Affirmations in New Thought and New Age terminology refer primarily to the practice of positive thinking and self-empowermentâ€”fostering a belief that "a positive mental attitude supported by affirmations will achieve success in anything." More specifically, an affirmation is a carefully formatted statement that should be repeated to one's self and written down frequently. For an affirmation to be effective, it needs to be present tense, positive, personal and specific"
  </blockquote>
  In our last blog post, we were asked to talk about Stereotype Threat. In this <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself">resource</a>, it specifically states that Stereotype Threat can be combatted with positive affirmations.

    <h2>My Exemplary Father</h2>
  I am going to take a minute to talk about my father. My father is someone that I deeply love and respect. He is a self-made man that rose out of poverty, worked his way through a bachelor's and a master's degree in a foreign language (my father is from Japan, and attended school in the US), built his business and provided a comfortable life for his family and for those who needed help around him. <br></br>
  I remember a very specific time in my life, in my teenage years, when my father had picked up a book on affirmations. He taught me that positive affirmations had a powerful effect on the mind, and that it is important to be careful about what I say or think. Some of the literature he shared with me that strongly influenced my core beliefs are: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_Man_Thinketh">As a Man Thinketh</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sweat-Small-Stuff-small-Series/dp/B000JGWDT6">Don't Sweat the Small Stuff</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Scovel_Shinn">The Wisdom of Florence Scovel Shinn</a>. The last book is strongly Christian-influcenced, nonetheless, a collection of powerful anecdotes on the influcence of affirmations.
    </br></br>
  I also remember walking into the restroom or my father's den to find cards with positive affirmations plastered all over the walls. I remember, in particular, seeing a card that said something like, "I believe in my children and that they would make the right decisions." Over the next decade or so, I noticed a significant change in the way my father interacted with me. Not that my father was ever an unkind man, but his tone seemed kinder and more patient. I can only imagine, being a father to a hormonal and slightly psychotic teeneager (and eventual young adult) was no easy task! I am sure, when your stupid teenager makes bad decisions, it invokes plenty of self-doubt about one's parenting skills. He had to find a way to deal with the challenges of being a parent, and I imagine affirmations were how he got through those years. :)  I have tremendous respect towards my dad for all that he accomplished, and I have no doubt the affirmations were part of his success.
  </br></br>
    <h2>Combatting Stereotype Threat with Affirmations</h2>
    I think this is something I've had to learn to do, from fairly early on, due to the fact that I often found myself so "different" from others. I explained in my previous post that I fit into a collection of minority groups - ethnic, religious, gender and marital status, etc. I still combat the stereotype threat of "a woman ought to be cooperative, friendly, tactfully quiet and walking 3 steps behind a man." I don't live in a world where this concept holds any grounds but it is difficult to un-do generations of religious and cultural teachings. I also combat the "a woman is no good at STEM tasks" stereotype, and more so the insecurity that is a byproduct of this stereotype threat, that I have nothing worthwhile to contribute to, in comparison to the men who seem to "get" these concepts so quickly.
    </br></br>
    <h2>Values</h2>
    I often have to remind myself that I am not a complete idiot, and that I do have value to add to most situations, faced with a stereotype threat. DBC asked us to pick a value that we felt is representative of ourselves and talk a bit about it. I think responsibility is something that I often try to live up to, though I often give off the "irresponsible" "party girl" vibe to the public due to my years of playing in a rock band. On the contrary, being a band lead and holding down a full-time professional job is not a task for an "irresponsible" person. For a band in a small town, a band lead is tasked with being a band manager, booker, promoter and a do-er of a multitude of other tasks that happen behind the glamours stage/scene. I would like to think that people could count on me to stay on top of important things, always respond to messages and do the right thing in a given situation, professionally or in extracurricular activities. I would show up to work, even if I had stayed up late the night before to close the bar out for the band. I rarely ever left work without completing all the tasks that I was given to do that day. This is a value that I posess that I need to remind myself often of, to combat stereotype threat.
    </br></br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    I think affirmations are something that everyone could use to remind themselves of the good values they hold and add to society. It could be about their kindness/compassion/empathy or sense of humor. It could be about their work ethics or ability to appreciate the small things in life. Positive affirmations every day could have a significant impact on both an individual and those around them.
