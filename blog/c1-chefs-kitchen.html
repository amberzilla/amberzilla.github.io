    <b>Kitchen vs Table</b>
    </br>
    </br>
    As part of our week1 homework, we were asked to watch a <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">video</a> of Dev Bootcamp founder Shereef discussing DBC's philosophy.
    </br>
    </br>
    Shereef mentioned this idea of being in the kitchen vs at the table in a restaurant. He said that at DBC they don't want people to come in with the attidue of a customer at a restaurant who might simply orders what's on the menu, pay the price and project an sentitled attitude if the exeprience isn't as described. Rather, they want people to come into the kitchen(DBC) with the attitude to learn, participate, and most importaly, contribute.
    </br>
    </br>
    I really love this philosophy. I have to agree with Shereef. In the West and in a capitalist society, it's easy to have an everything-is-a-product-or-service-and-my-money-entitles-me-to-being-an-asshole attitude. I get the sense from everything I've heard so far, that DBC has a much broader vision than simply churning out new junior devlopers. They want to teach people empathy, personal accountability, social responsibility and giving back to the community. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that they would expect students to leave any entitled attitudes at the door and be ready to collaborate with others, not just for their own good but for the good of others and the organization as a whole.

    <b>Exposing your ignorance</b>
    </br>
    </br>
    Shereef mentioned something I hadn't thought of before. The <i>learning trauma</i> that has been forced on us from the traditional educational system, wherein we look down upon those who don't know the answers or are ignorant, and praise those who know all the answers. Isn't it true, that a trait of a good student is one who is not ashamed to "expose their ignorance" and be willing to say, "I don't know" or "I don't know how, please show me." I very much appreciate DBC's sensitivity towards those of us who may have grown up with a fear of exposing our ignorance, and encouraging us to learn by putting those feelings of shame aside.

    <b>Leveling the playing field</b>
    </br>
    </br>
    I also very much appreciated the insight on the history / progress / improvements that DBC had made as an educational institution for their students. The 9 weeks of remote prep, which didn't exist in the beginning, had been placed in order to level the playing field and allow the students to "jam" together once they arrived at the on-site intensive.
    </br>
    </br>
    It was really cool that Shereef brought up the analogy of learning to play the guitar. That is exactly it. When I practice with my band, it made it so much easier when my bandmates had taken the time to listen to the sample recordings of a new song, or taken the time to practice a part of the song before they came to practice. We didn't end up needing to spend time teaching an unprepared person, but concentrate on writing new riffs or practicing timing.
    </br>
    </br>
    I can really get down with an organization that has put so much thought into how to maximize the experience of their students. If I'm honest, I am scared about the volume of work, but I think with the support of DBC and my cohortmates, I am going to be able to get through it. I'm really excited for this adventure!!
