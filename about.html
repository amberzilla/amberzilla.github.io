        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <img src="blog/blog_images/guitar.jpg" alt="me"/>
        <p>My name is Amber. I am a Japanese-American gal who
          programs by day and plays in a rockband by night. I studied Business Management (emphasis on entrepreneurship) but accidentally stumbled into tech, and haven't looked back. :) </br></br>

          I have 9 years of experience in software QA and am currently attending <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> in Chicago to learn the Ruby on Rails stack. I have served as a chapter leader for <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/salt-lake-city">Girl Develop It Salt Lake City</a> and have a strong interest in helping women in tech.</br></br>

          Outside of work, I am a band lead for a rockband in Salt Lake City called <a href="http://ladymurasaki.bandcamp.com/">Lady Murasaki</a>: I sing, play guitar and keys. Naturally, you will find me frequenting live music venues on the weekends and any chance I get, really. I also love <a href="https://medium.com/@ambertaniuchi/a-tribute-to-my-adventures-with-a-1982-vintage-schwinn-deluxe-varsity-bike-84a66b09e6a1">cycling</a> and taking walks in the park in the summertime. I was born in Hawaii but raised in Japan, so I speak Japanese and am happy to critique any sushi restaurant you may think is authentic. ;)
