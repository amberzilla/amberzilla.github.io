      <h2>Enumerables??</h2>
      Yeah I know, it sounds like a made-up word that doesn't exist, and one that would get auto-corrected by your phone immediately. It took me a minute to get comfortable with this weird word, but turns out I am going to have to become best friends with <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.1/Enumerable.html">enumerables</a> because they are powerful methods in Ruby that allow you to "<a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/enumerables/">traverse, search, sort and manipulate collections</a>," i.e., thisngs like arrays and hashes.
      </br>
      </br>
      <h2>Cycle</h2>
      Today I am going to talk about the Enumerable <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-cycle">cycle</a> method. In the Ruby documentation, this is the example that they show:
      </br>
      </br>
      <img src="blog_images/cycle.png">
      </br>
      </br>
      So basically, if you had an array that had the letters "a," "b," and "c" in them, applying the .cycle method to the array would cycle through each item infinitely.
      </br>
      </br>
      That's cool, but what on earth would I use this for?
      </br>
      </br>
      <h2>If I were a guest DJ</h2>
      In Salt Lake City, we have a super cool local radio station called <a href="http://www.krcl.org/">90.9FM KRCL</a> that is run by volunteers and local sponsors. They play a lot of indie music, great classic rock'n'roll, world music, jazz, etc.
      </br>
      </br>
      Let's pretend I were given a small guest DJ spot on KRCL, where I get to play 4 songs a day for a week, as a tribute to some of my favorite bands from the past. Ok, I'm a musican, not a DJ, but I boast a 3-crate collection of both classic and contemporary vinyl and I LOVE music!!
      </br>
      </br>
      I am going to pick 4 records from my stack:
      </br>
      </br>
      <code>
      steely_dan </br>
      hall_and_oats</br>
      earth_wind_fire</br>
      eagles</br>
      </code>
      </br>
      </br>
      I am going to make a list of songs from each album.
      </br>
      </br>
      <img src="blog_images/albums.png">
      </br>
      </br>
      While I'm at it, I am also going to create an array that cycles through days of the week. Note, I am adding .cycle to the end of the array to save myself some typing.
      </br>
      </br>
      <code>
      day = %w { Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday }.cycle </br>
      </code>
      </br>
      </br>
      <h2>Make me a playlist!</h2>
      Now I am going to create a playlist for the 7 days. The .cycle method has a cool thing called .next that you could apply to it, that will move through the next item in the array until you're done cycling through the array.
      </br></br>
      <code>
      7.times do</br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day = day.next</br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;song_1 = steely_dan.next</br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;song_2 = hall_and_oats.next</br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;song_3 = earth_wind_fire.next</br>
      </br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "#{day}'s Playlist: #{song_1}, #{song_2} and</br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#{song_3}"</br>
      end</br>
      </code>
      </br>
      </br>
      The output would look like this (I took a screenshot of the output in my terminal to save some space here)
      </br>
      </br>
      <img src="blog_images/playlist.png">
      </br>
      </br>
      Since some of the albums ran out of songs, you will notice that on Sunday's playlist, some of the songs were repeated again. I guess that's alright since these are all mega hits. ;)
      </br>
      </br>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      So the .cycle method not only allows you to cycle though a list of things, but allows you to cycle thourgh multiple lists and create things like schedules. It's pretty cool I think!
